# PowerDMS
Powerful DNS Management System for [*PowerDNS*][1].

## Description
PowerDMS is a Ruby on Rails application that provides a multi-user web interface for DNS management.
It works against the database server of a [*PowerDNS*][1] installation with the PostgreSQL/MySQL backend.

## Inspiration
I know there are other alternatives to managing [*PowerDNS*][1], and I'm not trying to fill a demand in the marked either. 
The main purpose of this application is to learn and enhance skills in Ruby/Rails programming.
