# PowerDMS
Powerful DNS Management System for [*PowerDNS*][1].

## Description
PowerDMS is a Ruby on Rails application that provides a multi-user web interface for DNS management.
It works against the database server of a [*PowerDNS*][1] installation with the PostgreSQL/MySQL backend.

## Inspiration
The goal of this application isn't to meet a demand nor replace existing solutions. Yes, I do know that 
there's many similar solutions out there. Some of you might even say I'm reinventing the wheel.

I'm doing this as a learning experience enhancing programming skills in Ruby/Rails.
