# PowerWDM
Powerful Web-based DNS Management for [*PowerDNS*][1].

## Description
PowerWDM is a Ruby on Rails application that provides a multi-user web interface for DNS management.
It works against the database server of a [*PowerDNS*][1] installation with the PostgreSQL/MySQL backend.

*Please note that this project isn't based on test driven development.*

## Inspiration
The goal of this application is not to meet a demand nor replace existing solutions. Yes, I do know that 
there's many similar solutions out there. 

I'm doing this as a learning experience enhancing programming skills in Ruby/Rails.

## Plugins
HAML, Gravatar

## Status
Not ready for production.
